## ðŸ“– Overview

This project implements a **vision-based vehicle trajectory estimation system** that combines **computer vision, GPS, and Doppler-based relative velocity estimation** for real-time risk assessment.  

Vehicles are detected from single or multiple cameras, and **license plates are used as stable reference points** (center + orientation). After target tracking builds continuous trajectories, **Taylor expansion** (local polynomial approximation) is applied for short-term trajectory prediction. GPS and Doppler (or visual proxy) provide relative velocity estimation, enabling calculation of **dynamic safe distances** and **collision risk alerts** in real time.
