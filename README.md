# Vision-Based-Vehicle-Trajectory-Estimation-System-with-Doppler-Effect-and-Taylor-Expansion
This project predicts vehicle motion by combining computer vision, GPS, and mathematical modeling. License plates are tracked as reference points, trajectories are approximated with Taylor expansion, and GPS plus Doppler-based velocity estimation enable dynamic safe distance calculation and real-time collision alerts.
